WebP is an image file format that Google has developed as a replacement for JPEG, PNG, and GIF file formats. WebP yields files that are smaller for the same quality, or of higher quality for the same size.[6] It supports both lossy and lossless compression,[7] as well as animation and alpha transparency.
